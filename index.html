            <p>I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the <strong>University of Washington</strong>, advised by <strong>Ranjay Krishna</strong>. My work falls at the intersection of <strong>NLP</strong> and <strong>HCI</strong>.</p>
            <p>Most of my research has been around inclusionary aspects of NLP systems. For example, my previous works have found that <strong>NLP systems have positionalities</strong> that make them not work well for the broader population, eventually marginalizing communities such as <strong>those who speak "low resource" languages</strong>. In our recent studies, we found that inclusion not only benefits the society, but also <strong>has the potential to improve performance of ML systems</strong>, ultimately contributing to AI progress.</p>
            <p>I also spend time thinking about and designing <strong>seamless human-computer interactions</strong>. This is mostly manifested in the form of user interfaces, some of which are now part of <strong>Firefox, Bugzilla, & other open-source projects</strong>, <strong>published as research papers</strong>, or simply ended up as <strong>fun side projects</strong>. I believe we still have a long way to go in figuring out naturalistic interactions. Some of my thoughts on this topic is covered in a <strong>recent tutorial we gave at EMNLP 2023</strong>.</p>
